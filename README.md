## How to Use

- Clone the repo

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/deepjyoti30/startpage
    ```

    Alternately, you can download and extract from the browser.

### Chrome

- On chrome, open extensions from the tool menu or open it from [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).

- Click on load unpacked, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo and select it.

### Firefox

- Open ```about:debugging``` from your Firefox browser.
- Click on This Firefox and select ```Load Temporary Add On...```
- Open the cloned repo directory and select any file there (preferrably ```manifest.json```)
- It should be installed.

## Upcoming

I'm thinking of pushing the add on to their respective add on stores, I'll add that ASAP.

## Settings

For the time being you need to edit the ```config.json``` file present in the root directory of the repo and then install the extension by following the above steps.
